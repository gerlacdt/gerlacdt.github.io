# Introduction

I have always been passionate about productivity. As a dedicated software
engineer, the pursuit of continuous learning and the creation of high-quality,
maintainable code are paramount. However, focusing solely on honing technical
skills while neglecting other facets of life can lead to an imbalance, a state
best described by Kelsey Hightower's insightful observation:

"If you focus too much on technology and technical skills, you'll end up as a
senior engineer and a junior human being." - Kelsey Hightower

Previously, I've shared [best practices](../habits) concerning coding and
engineering productivity from a technical standpoint. But to unlock even greater
levels of productivity and, more importantly, to cultivate a fulfilling and
purposeful life, we must explore beyond the realm of code. Software engineering
is a significant part of our professional identity, but it does not encompass
the entirety of our being. A well-developed individual embraces a broader
spectrum of interests.

In the following sections, I aim to present the routines, books, and
perspectives that have personally empowered me to lead a healthier, happier, and
more responsible life.

# Health

### Sports/Calistenics

Having worked as a software engineer for nearly 20 years, the shift to a
full-time home office in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic brought significant
changes to my daily routine. Staying home predominantly had a notable impact on
my physical well-being. The reduced physical activity led to issues such as back
pain and other related problems. Recognizing the need for change, I realized
that incorporating regular exercise was the key to improvement.

Being naturally inclined towards a less active lifestyle, I opted for
calisthenics due to its convenience of being primarily home-based. Initially,
adhering to a consistent workout schedule proved challenging. However, regular
exercise has since become an indispensable part of my life. The benefits have
been truly transformative: not only has my back pain subsided, but I also
experience increased energy levels and a stronger immune system. My friends and
colleagues have even remarked on my consistently improved mood.

I highly recommend investing in a guided workout plan that provides a structured
schedule and effective exercises. In my experience,
[Calisthenics Movement](https://www.calimove.com/p/home) stands out as an
excellent program. Their approach is science-backed, and their instructors
possess two decades of expertise. For those unfamiliar,
[calisthenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics) is a form of training
that primarily or exclusively utilizes body weight for exercises such as
push-ups, pull-ups, and squats.

A word of caution: it's crucial not to overexert yourself at the beginning. Your
joints and tendons need time to adapt to the new demands, and a thorough warm-up
is essential to prevent injuries â€“ a mistake I personally made. As an additional
piece of advice, don't limit your focus solely to strength training.
Incorporating mobility and flexibility sessions is equally important. Good
mobility can significantly alleviate various types of musculoskeletal pain,
including issues in the back, neck, and shoulders.

While regular exercise is fundamental, achieving optimal health and strength
also necessitates attention to nutrition, which is just as vital as your
consistent calisthenics sessions.

### Heathy Nutrition

Beyond calisthenics, a healthy approach to eating is equally crucial. While
nutrition is a vast subject that can feel overwhelming, **the single most
impactful change you can make is to reduce your sugar consumption.** I highly
recommend the book
[Fat Chance: The Hidden Truth About Sugar, Obesity, and Disease](https://www.amazon.de/Fat-Chance-Hidden-Obesity-Disease/dp/000751414X)
by Robert Lustig. This book was truly eye-opening in understanding the
detrimental effects of sugar. It clearly explains the cycles of insulin and
leptin and how sugar disrupts their balance, leading to addiction. Leptin is the
hormone responsible for signaling satiety to our body. Excessive insulin
production, triggered by sugar intake, reduces leptin levels, preventing us from
feeling satisfied. This eventually creates a vicious cycle: the more sugar you
consume, the more your body craves it. The only way to mitigate the insulin
spike caused by sugar is to consume it alongside fiber-rich foods such as
broccoli, oats, and other vegetables and fruits.

By significantly reducing or eliminating sugar from your daily meals, you'll
likely experience increased energy levels, improved alertness, and a more
vibrant feeling overall.

### Sleep

For a healthy life, sufficient and good-quality sleep is indispensable.
[Why We Sleep](https://www.gatesnotes.com/why-we-sleep) by Matthew Walker offers
a fascinating and in-depth exploration of the science behind sleep. In it,
you'll discover valuable insights into establishing healthy sleep habits:

- **Establish a consistent sleep schedule:** Try to go to bed and wake up around
  the same time each day, even on weekends.
- **Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime:** Refrain from activities that
  can overstimulate your brain in the hours leading up to sleep, such as
  exposure to the blue light emitted by smartphones and intense physical
  exercise.
- **Limit alcohol consumption:** Alcohol can suppress the crucial Rapid Eye
  Movement (REM) sleep phase, which is vital for cognitive functions.

Furthermore, a short nap in the afternoon can significantly boost alertness and
enhance creativity. It's particularly important for older individuals to
prioritize sleep, as the body increasingly relies on this recovery period.
