Logging is a major pillar for well-designed applications. It is not only a large
help during development but also critical for failure analysis and debugging.

Further logging is essential for observability in production. Nonetheless, I
often encounter codebases with lousy logging practices. This manifests itself in
useless logging missing context or in over-logging thereby bringing down the
whole system. People often forget that logging is expensive. In the following I
want to list the most important logging traits for modern cloud native
applications.

### Good

- logs are a stream of text formatted events, typically streamed to STDOUT
- one log event corresponds to one line
- use structured logging with a machine-parsable format like JSON with
  predefined properties like timestamp, environment, node, cluster, log level,
  app name, message, request-id
- prefer silent logs like described in the
  [unix philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html)

- log only actionable events, see
  [silent logging](https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2016/02/07/logging-v-instrumentation.html)
- use log-levels appropriately
- log errors with stracktrace and other context information like user-id,
  transaction-id, request-id. The provided context allows you to correlate logs
  across different systems and pinpoint issues quickly.
- aggregate your logs in a central system like ElasticSearch or Datadog to
  enable powerful search, analysis, and anomaly detection.

### Bad

- don't log into files
- don't log multiple lines for one log event
- don't log DEBUG information in production. The sheer volume can overwhelm the
  system and even cripple the log indexing infrastructure.
- don't log sensitive data, user-related data and secrets like passwords must
  not be logged regardless of the log-level.
- don't use logs as persistent data storage, treat them as a transient stream of
  events with a defined retention period.
