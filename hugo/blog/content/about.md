# About me

My name is **Daniel Gerlach**. I work at [Mercedes-Benz-Mobility AG](https://www.mercedes-benz-mobility.com/en/).

I am a happy long-term [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) user (almost
15 years now). At work I use different programming languages:

- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Go](https://golang.org)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

I am interested in programming and have a favour for lispy-languages
like [Common Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/),
[Scheme](https://racket-lang.org/) or
[Clojure](https://clojure.org/). Also I am a strong supporter of
functional programming paradigms like immutability, reference
transparency, pure functions, high-order functions, functions as
first-class citizens and composition of functions. I think functional
programming makes coding more fun and comprehensible. Nevertheless I
also like pragmatic programming languages like Go.

Nowadays I also do a lot of cloud infrastructure engineering with
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) and
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

My coding principle is:

> “Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?”

Brian W. Kernighan
