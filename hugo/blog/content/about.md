My name is **Daniel Gerlach**. I work at [Mercedes-Benz-Mobility AG](https://www.mercedes-benz-mobility.com/en/).

I am a software engineer with a professional background in:

- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

I am a strong supporter of functional programming paradigms like immutability,
reference transparency, pure functions, high-order functions, functions as
first-class citizens and composition of functions. I think functional
programming makes coding more fun and comprehensible. Nevertheless I also like
pragmatic modern system programming languages like [Go](https://golang.org) and
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). In my free time I also play around with
lispy languages:

- [Common Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org/)
- [Scheme](https://racket-lang.org/)
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)

Nowadays I also do a lot of cloud infrastructure engineering with
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) and
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

My coding principle is:

> “Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?”

Brian W. Kernighan
