But to unlock even greater levels of productivity and, more importantly, to cultivate a fulfilling and purposeful life, we must explore beyond the realm of code. Software engineering is a significant part of our professional identity, but it does not encompass the entirety of our being. A well-developed individual embraces a broader spectrum of interests.\nIn the following sections, I aim to present the routines, books, and perspectives that have personally empowered me to lead a healthier, happier, and more responsible life.\nHealth Sports/Calisthenics Having worked as a software engineer for nearly 20 years, the shift to a full-time home office in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic brought significant changes to my daily routine. Staying home predominantly had a notable impact on my physical well-being. The reduced physical activity led to issues such as back pain and other related problems. Recognizing the need for change, I realized that incorporating regular exercise was the key to improvement.\nBeing naturally inclined towards a less active lifestyle, I opted for Calisthenics due to its convenience of being primarily home-based. Initially, adhering to a consistent workout schedule proved challenging. However, regular exercise has since become an indispensable part of my life. The benefits have been truly transformative: not only has my back pain subsided, but I also experience increased energy levels and a stronger immune system. My friends and colleagues have even remarked on my consistently improved mood.\nI highly recommend investing in a guided workout plan that provides a structured schedule and effective exercises. In my experience, Calisthenics Movement stands out as an excellent program. Their approach is science-backed, and their instructors possess two decades of expertise. For those unfamiliar, Calisthenics is a form of training that primarily utilizes body weight for exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, and squats.\nA word of caution: it’s crucial not to overexert yourself at the beginning. Your joints and tendons need time to adapt to the new demands, and a thorough warm-up is essential to prevent injuries – a mistake I personally made. As an additional piece of advice, don’t limit your focus solely to strength training. Incorporating mobility and flexibility sessions is equally important. Good mobility can significantly alleviate various types of musculoskeletal pain, including issues in the back, neck, and shoulders.\nHealthy Nutrition Beyond Calisthenics, a healthy approach to eating is equally crucial. While nutrition is a vast subject that can feel overwhelming, the single most impactful change you can make is to reduce your sugar consumption. I highly recommend the book Fat Chance: The Hidden Truth About Sugar, Obesity, and Disease by Robert Lustig. This book was truly eye-opening in understanding the detrimental effects of sugar. It clearly explains the cycles of insulin and leptin and how sugar disrupts their balance, leading to addiction. Leptin is the hormone responsible for signaling satiety to our body. Excessive insulin production, triggered by sugar intake, reduces leptin levels, preventing us from feeling satisfied. This eventually creates a vicious cycle: the more sugar you consume, the more your body craves it. The only way to mitigate the insulin spike caused by sugar is to consume it alongside fiber-rich foods such as broccoli, oats, and other vegetables and fruits or by reducing your sugar consumption itself.\nBy significantly reducing or eliminating sugar from your daily meals, you’ll likely experience increased energy levels, improved alertness, and a more vibrant feeling overall.\nSleep For a healthy life, sufficient and good-quality sleep is indispensable. Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker offers a fascinating and in-depth exploration of the science behind sleep. In it, you’ll discover valuable insights into establishing healthy sleep habits:\n Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up around the same time each day, even on weekends. Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime: Refrain from activities that can overstimulate your brain in the hours leading up to sleep, such as exposure to the blue light emitted by smartphones and intense physical exercise. Limit alcohol consumption: Alcohol can suppress the crucial Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep phase, which is vital for cognitive functions.  Furthermore, a short nap in the afternoon can significantly boost alertness and enhance creativity. It’s particularly important for older individuals to prioritize sleep, as the body increasingly relies on this recovery period.\nNon-Tech Interests Philosophy As a software engineer who has accumulated years of experience, you naturally acquire proficiency in numerous programming languages and diverse technologies, mastering your craft. However, confining oneself solely to this technical domain can feel limiting, and the constant pursuit of the next trendy technology can eventually become monotonous. As Kelsey Hightower aptly put it, you risk becoming a senior developer but remaining a “junior human being.” I firmly believe that studying Philosophy offers a wealth of benefits. It sharpens your critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Exposure to a multitude of perspectives broadens your own viewpoint, expands your horizons, and fosters open-mindedness. You’ll engage in deeper contemplation of crucial topics, such as the nature of our society, and gain a greater appreciation for the freedoms and privileges we enjoy in the Western world. The “Age of Enlightenment” stands as one of the most significant milestones in human history, driven by the insights of philosophers and intellectuals.\nThe Beginning of Infinity builds upon this very idea, elaborating on how the Enlightenment liberated us from the constraints of authority and dogmatic thinking. It ushered in an era where individuals could think for themselves, critically evaluate each other’s ideas, and rigorously refute theories. Knowledge, according to the book, is inherently infinite because each new discovery invariably unveils further areas of the unknown. Coupled with the seemingly infinite nature of the universe, this led David Deutsch to call the Enlightenment “the beginning of infinity.”\nBeyond philosophy, delving into human history is also profoundly “enlightening”. It cultivates a deeper awareness of our collective achievements and fosters a sense of gratitude for the present. However, we must not take our free Western society for granted; the ongoing effort to champion an open society and actively resist its adversaries is a constant necessity. Karl Popper’s seminal work, The Open Society and Its Enemies, offers profound insights into this crucial matter.\nOther books about history I strongly recommend:\n Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind Nexus A Brief History of Information Networks The Ascent of Man  “Nexus” is a particularly insightful exploration of how information networks impact our society. It provides a deeper understanding of how both democracies and tyrannies utilize information channels to achieve their objectives, and also elucidates why democracies are especially vulnerable to social media and other mass communication tools. Interestingly, Yuval Noah Harari explains that the existence of both democracy and totalitarian states is contingent upon the presence of a mass communication – a fascinating point to consider because we live more and more in a world dominated by social media.\nMeditation Another routine that has significantly benefited me is meditation. While I don’t practice it professionally, I meditate two or three times a week for about five minutes. Meditation helps to induce relaxation, and afterwards, I find myself more alert and able to maintain focus for extended periods. Furthermore, it effectively reduces stress levels and anxiety. Perhaps even more valuable is the increased resilience it fosters against negative emotions such as anger and fear.\nPersonally, I highly recommend the book Shaolin Spirit. It provides an excellent introduction to meditation and also offers insights into profound life philosophies, specifically Zen and Taoism. The book presents practical ways to integrate these principles into your daily life, and actively applying them can noticeably improve your overall well-being.\nLearning How to Learn Learning stands out as one of life’s most crucial skills, making it essential to invest in honing your learning abilities. Barbara Oakley’s book, A Mind for Numbers, offers exceptional guidance in this area. She also provides a valuable free Coursera Course. Both resources are truly remarkable and will transform your approach to learning and tackling complex subjects, ultimately making you a more effective learner.\nIn addition to cultivating a positive learning attitude, developing a growth mindset is equally important. This is particularly vital for children, as they need to understand that they can achieve anything through dedicated effort and time. This perspective contrasts with a static mindset, where individuals believe in fixed talents and tend to give up early when faced with challenging skills, thinking they lack inherent ability and will never succeed.\nA powerful way to boost your own motivation and discover greater purpose in life is to teach others. Not only will you deepen your own understanding through the process of explaining concepts, but you’ll also empower others to reach their goals. This act of sharing knowledge is a wonderful way to forge friendships and build strong relationships in general.\nHumans/Relationships All the tips mentioned above focus on the individual – on yourself. However, humans are social beings and truly thrive when they spend quality time with family and friends. Therefore, investing in strong relationships with your close ones is essential. Additionally, be mindful of the company you keep; avoid toxic and perpetually pessimistic individuals, as they can significantly impact your well-being. Lastly, consider reading some books about leadership and how to be a good team member. Software development is a collaborative effort, and the most successful software engineers not only excel technically but also possess strong communication skills, are excellent team players and mentors, and ultimately, bring optimism and positive energy to the team.\nFinal Words I hope some of these ideas resonated with you and sparked your interest in at least one of the topics discussed. Personally, these routines and practices have had a positive impact on my life. I feel better overall, possess more energy, and generally maintain a more positive mood. I experience a greater sense of balance and find myself more resilient when facing various challenges, such as anxieties about job security or coping with difficult experiences and events. Beyond feeling better, I also believe I understand the world a bit more clearly, allowing me to make significantly better decisions in my life (and my job).\nDon’t forget, where ever your starting point is:\n It’s the beginning of infinity.\n References  Fat Chance: The Hidden Truth About Sugar, Obesity, and Disease Calisthenics Movement A Mind for Numbers - Barbara Oakley Learning How To Learn, Coursera Free Course Shaolin Spirit Why We Sleep  ","wordCount":"1815","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-04-18T09:00:00+01:00","dateModified":"2025-04-18T09:00:00+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Gerlach"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gerlacdt.github.io/blog/posts/routines/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Daniel's programming rants","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gerlacdt.github.io/blog/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gerlacdt.github.io/blog accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a>
