Martin is a seminal programming book. A whole generation of developers, including myself, became better programmers by Uncle Bob’s advice. But after almost twenty years, does the book still hold up to its high standards? Was some advice given by Clean Code questionable or even wrong? Are there better alternatives nowadays?\nTo be fair, the author himself claims in the preface that “some recommendations in the book are controversial and people might disagree”. In this article I try to disagree. Let’s go through to the good, bad and ugly parts of Clean Code.\nThe Good Besides the book’s programming guidance, I think the greatest achievement of the book is coining the term Clean Code and creating a general awareness about code quality:\n The only way to go fast is to go well - Uncle Bob\n The impact of the book in the programming world is second to none. All of a sudden code quality, readability and maintainability were in the developers' focus. I truly believe this made the programmers’ world a better place.\nThe book itself is full of great programming advice, mainly written in Java but applicable in other programming languages as well. It’s especially valuable for new programmers, starting the craft. You will find foundational tips regarding function and variable names that they should be intention-revealing and searchable. Other timeless ideas like the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself), Command-Query separation and noteworthy metaphors like the boy scout rule are also presented.\nAdditionally, numerous useful programming practices are given. Senior developers take them for granted but junior developers need to learn them first, e.g.:\n Good naming uses problem-domain names for functions, classes and variables. This is also a main principle in DDD, namely the ubiquitous language. Good exception handling uses unchecked exceptions and provides as much context as possible Good unit tests should be FIRST (Fast, Independent, Repeatable Self-validated, Timely) and should assert a single behaviour Classes should comply to the Single Responsibility Principle Functions should do one thing and all statements should have the same level of abstraction pure functions without side-effects should be preferred Functions should comply to the Command-Query Separation pattern Keep your code DRY Don’t comment code, delete it - there is version control Good boundaries are important. Don’t depend too much on 3rd party libs, hide them behind interfaces. This will keep your code testable Good Data Abstractions enabled by encapsulation/information hiding will preserve class invariants and will guarantee error-resistant and comprehensible APIs.  These practices are timeless for all programmers - new and old. I keep finding myself giving these tips over and over to team members in pair programming sessions, discussions or other kind of talks.\nAnother highlight of the book is the extensive code smells compendium where the book describes the most common code smells with their corresponding countermeasures. It’s not only important to know how to write good code but also how to detect bad code.\nThe Bad Even a seminal book is not perfect. In the following, I try to describe my two main points of criticism. First, while Clean Code remains a classic resource for software engineering, some of its content is obsolete. For example the heavy Java focus, the reliance on EJBs and AspectJ limits the applicability for modern programming practices. Additionally, the covered concurrency topics are shallow and too low-level, especially considering the rise of first-class concurrency languages like Go and Rust. These new languages offer more robust and efficient approaches to concurrency. Furthermore, the book primarily uses Java with Object-Oriented Programming examples, which may not adequately represent the diversity of modern programming styles today. Especially it lacks a comprehensive exploration of functional programming concepts, including immutability, referential transparency, high-order functions, and the emphasis on avoiding side effects. Such principles are occasionally mentioned but not consistently applied.\nSecond, the book’s dogmatic presentation of coding principles can be a double-edged sword. While it offers valuable advice, its lack of nuanced explanations and context can lead to misunderstandings, particularly for newer developers. Overzealous adherence to rules like “small functions” or the “DRY principle” without seeing the costs is harmful to code quality. For example, blindly applying the “DRY principle” can result in excessive abstraction, leading to a proliferation of tiny, overly complex classes. This can make the code harder to understand and maintain. A better approach, recognizing that sometimes duplication is acceptable to improve readability or performance, is essential for effective software development. Even more important is that we should not place tactical coding practices above higher design principles like coupling, cohesion, information hiding etc. Some quotes directly from the book:\n The first rule of function is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. - Clean Code, chapter 3, p34\n  Every time you see a duplication in the code, it represents a missed opportunity for abstraction. - Clean Code, chapter 17, p289\n This writing style can also contribute to cargo-cult programming, where developers blindly follow rules without understanding the underlying reasons. More often than not, it leads to heated debates and misunderstandings, as people cling to their interpretations of the book’s advice without considering their specific project context. I admit though that it is not the book’s fault that people are not able to judge about their situations but the mantra-like writing style does not really encourage deeper reasoning. Funnily the book sometimes diverges from the this writing style and condemns dogmatism:\n In an effort to make our classes and methods small, we might create too many tiny classes and methods. So this rule suggest that that we also keep our function and class counts lows.\n  High class and method counts are sometimes the result of pointless dogmatism.\n  Is there a set of simple practices that can replace experience? Clearly not.\n  Clean Code, chapter 12, p176\n These passages are rare and I wish the book would contain much more of such diligent statements that triggers the reader’s thinking process and nudges him to use his own judgement. It’s important to remember that software development is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. Good developers understand the principles outlined in Clean Code but also possess the judgment to apply them appropriately in different scenarios. Good advice and practices always come with trade-offs. These trade-offs must be transparent and known, otherwise it’s not possible to use them adequately. Rules and guidelines are only tools in our toolbox but we need to reason and judge about them for every problem anew. That’s why I like Kent Beck’s quote so much:\n It depends. - Kent Beck\n Basically, with this tiny quote Kent covers the soul of software engineering. It’s also my most used sentence at work 😄.\nThe Ugly The book’s examples, particularly the infamous prime generator, often contradict the advice it offers. These examples prioritize verbosity over clarity, making them difficult to understand, especially for beginners. They frequently rely on Java-specific frameworks like FitNesse and JUnit internals, creating a barrier for programmers unfamiliar with those tools. Additionally, some examples, like the Argument Parser, sprawl across tens of pages, overwhelming readers. The overemphasis on dogma leads to convoluted code, hindering the learning process for “programmer journeymen,” the intended audience of the book. That’s why the code examples are the ugly part of the book.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69  // from Clean Code chapter 10 // listing 10-8  package literatePrimes;  import java.util.ArrayList;  public class PrimeGenerator {  private static int[] primes;  private static ArrayListInteger multiplesOfPrimeFactors;   protected static int[] generate(int n) {  primes = new int[n];  multiplesOfPrimeFactors = new ArrayListInteger();  set2AsFirstPrime();  checkOddNumbersForSubsequentPrimes();  return primes;  }   private static void set2AsFirstPrime() {  primes[0] = 2;  multiplesOfPrimeFactors.add(2);  }   private static void checkOddNumbersForSubsequentPrimes() {  int primeIndex = 1;  for (int candidate = 3;  primeIndex  primes.length;  candidate += 2) {  if (isPrime(candidate))  primes[primeIndex++] = candidate;  }  }   private static boolean isPrime(int candidate) {  if (isLeastRelevantMultipleOfNextLargerPrimeFactor(candidate)) {  multiplesOfPrimeFactors.add(candidate);  return false;  }  return isNotMultipleOfAnyPreviousPrimeFactor(candidate);  }   private static boolean isLeastRelevantMultipleOfNextLargerPrimeFactor(int candidate) {  int nextLargerPrimeFactor = primes[multiplesOfPrimeFactors.size()];  int leastRelevantMultiple = nextLargerPrimeFactor * nextLargerPrimeFactor;  return candidate == leastRelevantMultiple;  }   private static boolean isNotMultipleOfAnyPreviousPrimeFactor(int candidate) {  for (int n = 1; n  multiplesOfPrimeFactors.size(); n++) {  if (isMultipleOfNthPrimeFactor(candidate, n))  return false;  }  return true;  }   private static boolean isMultipleOfNthPrimeFactor(int candidate, int n) {  return  candidate == smallestOddNthMultipleNotLessThanCandidate(candidate, n);  }   private static int smallestOddNthMultipleNotLessThanCandidate(int candidate, int n) {  int multiple = multiplesOfPrimeFactors.get(n);  while (multiple  candidate)  multiple += 2 * primes[n];  multiplesOfPrimeFactors.set(n, multiple);  return multiple;  } }   The prime generator example is an excellent candidate for demonstrating the pitfalls of overly dogmatic adherence to good practices. The primary issue lies in its excessive function granularity. This fragmentation forces readers to constantly jump between functions, hindering comprehension. The sheer number of tiny functions necessitates overly verbose names, further obfuscating the code’s intent. For instance, consider the following function names:\n smallestOddNthMultipleNotLessThanCandidate() isLeastRelevantMultipleOfNextLargerPrimeFactor()  These convoluted names highlight the failure of abstraction. In this case a few lines of code are more easily understood than the function name itself.\nRegarding side-effects, the prime generator example applies exactly the opposite of Clean Code. The book clearly consults to avoid side-effects but the prime generator is full of them! A short primer what a side effect is:\n a function is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable outside its local environment.\n  Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable, modifying a static local variable, modifying a mutable argument passed by reference, performing I/O or calling other functions with side-effects.\n Unfortunately, almost all private static functions of the prime generator have a side-effect because they change internal static class variables. Worse yet, some side-effects are hidden in nested functions making the code even harder to understand.\nCommand-Query Separation(CQS) is highly recommended in the book and is a great way of writing intention-revealing APIs but it is also disregarded in the prime generator example. A short description of CQS:\n It (CQS) states that every method should either be a command that performs an action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both.\n Whereby a command has a side-effect but no return value and a query returns a value but has no side-effect. Consistently applied, CQS hugely helps to write intention-revealing interfaces and maintainable code. The function boolean isPrime(int candidate) though returns a value but also has a side-effect. It changes a static class variable, thereby giving the wrong intention to the API user.\nLastly, the Prime Generator example employs a non-pragmatic Java style. The use of static class variables and functions introduces several issues. Firstly, it compromises thread safety. Secondly, the protected static int[] generate(int n) function returns a static class variable, exposing class internals and potentially allowing external modifications that can violate the class’s invariants.\nUnfortunately, this style might mislead junior programmers into adopting these practices in their projects. The inclusion of such examples in a book like Clean Code could inadvertently promote this suboptimal coding style. While it could be true that this style was acceptable in the past, it has always been considered poor practice - in any time period[1].\nFor a comparison, you can look up my primary number generator implementation closely based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with some supporting comments - yes sometimes comments are more helpful than refactoring everything into tiny functions!\nConclusion Would I recommend Clean Code for new programmers? Yes, but not anymore as the first Software Engineering book. In my opinion there are better alternatives:\n A Philosophy of Software Design Code That Fits in Your Head The Pragmatic Programmer more books on my personal reading list  The above books contain great engineering wisdom and in my opinion they are written in a open-minded way. The readers have some leeway for their own thinking. The books give more background about the practices, trade-offs and why these practices are useful. Although they miss the catchy name - Clean Code is matchless. However Clean Code is a classic and still a required read because it contains timeless advice. Just make sure you don’t apply the practices blindly and without your own judgement.\nLast but not least, I want to point out that Clean Code is an brilliant name and a great foundation for other software engineering inventions.

<a href=https://gist.github.com/gerlacdt/41cf41c1f32093ca2866d35dffc88481>prime generator</a>
example is an excellent candidate for demonstrating the pitfalls of overly
dogmatic adherence to good practices. The primary issue lies in its excessive
function granularity. This fragmentation forces readers to constantly jump
between functions, hindering comprehension. The sheer number of tiny functions
necessitates overly verbose names, further obfuscating the code&rsquo;s intent. For
instance, consider the following function names:</p><ul><li><em>smallestOddNthMultipleNotLessThanCandidate()</em></li><li><em>isLeastRelevantMultipleOfNextLargerPrimeFactor()</em></li></ul><p>These convoluted names highlight the failure of abstraction. In this case a few
lines of code are more easily understood than the function name itself.</p><p>Regarding side-effects, the prime generator example applies exactly the opposite
of Clean Code. The book clearly consults to avoid side-effects but the prime
generator is full of them! A short primer what a
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)>side effect</a>
is:</p><blockquote><p>a function is said to have a side effect if it modifies some state variable
outside its local environment.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Example side effects include modifying a non-local variable, modifying a
static local variable, modifying a mutable argument passed by reference,
performing I/O or calling other functions with side-effects.</p></blockquote><p>Unfortunately, almost all <code>private static</code> functions of the prime generator have
a side-effect because they change internal static class variables. Worse yet,
some side-effects are hidden in nested functions making the code even harder to
understand.</p><p><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command%E2%80%93query_separation>Command-Query Separation(CQS)</a>
is highly recommended in the book and is a great way of writing
intention-revealing APIs but it is also disregarded in the prime generator
example. A short description of CQS:</p><blockquote><p>It (CQS) states that every method should either be a command that performs an
action, or a query that returns data to the caller, but not both.</p></blockquote><p>Whereby a command has a side-effect but no return value and a query returns a
value but has no side-effect. Consistently applied, CQS hugely helps to write
intention-revealing interfaces and maintainable code. The function
<code>boolean isPrime(int candidate)</code> though returns a value but also has a
side-effect. It changes a static class variable, thereby giving the wrong
intention to the API user.</p><p>Lastly, the Prime Generator example employs a non-pragmatic Java style. The use
of static class variables and functions introduces several issues. Firstly, it
compromises thread safety. Secondly, the
<code>protected static int[] generate(int n)</code> function returns a static class
variable, exposing class internals and potentially allowing external
modifications that can violate the class&rsquo;s invariants.</p><p>Unfortunately, this style might mislead junior programmers into adopting these
practices in their projects. The inclusion of such examples in a book like Clean
Code could inadvertently promote this suboptimal coding style. While it could be
true that this style was acceptable in the past, it has always been considered
poor practice - in any time period[1].</p><p>For a comparison, you can look up my
<a href=https://gist.github.com/gerlacdt/772c86b2f592a16ea6303defaf74974f>primary number generator</a>
implementation closely based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm with some
supporting comments - yes sometimes comments are more helpful than refactoring
everything into tiny functions!</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>Would I recommend <em>Clean Code</em> for new programmers? Yes, but not anymore as the
first Software Engineering book. In my opinion there are better alternatives:</p><ul><li><a href=https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php>A Philosophy of Software Design</a></li><li><a href=https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/code-that-fits/9780137464302/>Code That Fits in Your Head</a></li><li><a href=https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/>The Pragmatic Programmer</a></li><li>more books on my <a href=/blog/posts/programming-books/>personal reading list</a></li></ul><p>The above books contain great engineering wisdom and in my opinion they are
written in a open-minded way. The readers have some leeway for their own
thinking. The books give more background about the practices, trade-offs and
<strong>why</strong> these practices are useful. Although they miss the catchy name - <em>Clean
Code</em> is matchless. However <em>Clean Code</em> is a classic and still a required read
because it contains timeless advice. Just make sure you don&rsquo;t apply the
practices blindly and without your own judgement.</p><p>Last but not least, I want to point out that <em>Clean Code</em> is an brilliant name
and a great foundation for other software engineering inventions. I came up with
one of my own 😁:</p><ul><li><a href=/blog/posts/cccp/><strong><em>The Continuous Clean Code Process (CCCP)</em></strong></a> - cleaning
