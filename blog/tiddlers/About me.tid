title: About me
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

My name is ''Daniel Gerlach''. 
I am an application developer at https://www.moovel.com/en

For programming i used Emacs as for a bunch bunch of  programming languages like:

* [[Java|https://openjdk.java.net/]]
* [[Javascript|https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript]]
* [[Typescript|https://www.typescriptlang.org/]]
* [[python|https://www.python.org/]]
* [[go|https://golang.org]]

My interests are programming in general. I have a favour for lispy-languages like //[[Common Lisp|https://lisp-lang.org/]], [[Scheme|https://racket-lang.org/]] or [[Clojure|https://clojure.org/]]//. Also i am a strong supporter of functional programming paradigms like immutability, reference transparency, high-order functions, functions as first-class citizens. Nevertheless i also like pragmatic programming languages like go.

My main coding principle is:

<<<
“Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?” 
<<<Brian W. Kernighan
