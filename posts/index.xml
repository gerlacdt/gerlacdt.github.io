      <description>Introduction Most of the breakthrough inventions in historic and modern Software Engineering are related to feedback loops. They are essential for productive software development, Developer Effectiveness and Developer Happiness. The faster the feedback the more productive developers are. Remember the dawn of computing when computers were programmed with punch cards, programmers had to turn in their cards over night and only the next day they got the result &amp;ndash; often with a compile error ðŸ˜ž.</description>

      <description>We all know them: programmers with long term experience stuck on a low-level of our craft not corresponding to their quantity of experience. Great programmers are creative workers and problem-solvers and one of their most important traits is: never stop learning &amp;ndash; but getting stuck in its own comfort zone and becoming reluctant to change is deeply wired into human nature (Humans are hard-wired to follow the path of least resistance).</description>

      <description>Abstractions are essential in order to build complex systems and keep complexity under control. Especially in software development we rely on many abstractions to make our life easier. Although good abstractions do not &amp;ldquo;leak&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s always helpful to understand the background and the details behind them.
The following list (in chronological order) of classic computer science papers will give you insights of inventions of the last decades which are considered nowadays common sense.</description>

      <title>Database Integration Tests with Docker Sidecar in Jenkins</title>

      <description>More often than not, developers want to test the source code against a real database instead of Fakes or Test Doubles during a CI job in order to verify the code works as expected. Therefore a clean database is needed for every CI-job. One solution is to use a shared instance of the database in your existing test-environment which get cleaned before and after a job. But this suffers from being &amp;ldquo;shared&amp;rdquo; and you never can run multiple CI-jobs in parallel without jobs interfering with each other.</description>

      <description>Do you have a list of websites you visit regularly? Just to find out nothing new was added. This manual scraping is often a waste of time. Worse yet, scanning and filtering these websites for new interesting content is even more time consuming.
Subscribing to an RSS feed can reduce your effort immensely. An RSS feed &amp;ldquo;pushes&amp;rdquo; the newest updates to subscribers and they will never miss updates. In order to make use of RSS feeds you need a &amp;ldquo;feed reader&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;feed aggregator&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I collected my favorite quotes about product management:
 We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries.
 Marty Cagan, Inspired
 It doesnâ€™t matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build.
 Marty Cagan, Inspired
 The use of OKRs in most companies is a mess - because itâ€™s a framework that originated in an empowered team environment - and most companies applying it today donâ€™t have empowered teams.</description>

      <description>In Joel Spolsky&amp;rsquo;s blog post &amp;ldquo;The Joel Test: 12 Steps to better Code&amp;rdquo;, he describes a test composed of twelve simple yes-no questions. For a yes you get one point. 10 points are acceptable and 12 are perfect. If you have less than 10 points, you will get in trouble with your software &amp;ndash; sooner or later.
For a quick self-check, these are the original questions:
 Do you use source control?</description>

      <description>In my one of my previous posts i wrote about Good Unit Tests. During my research i discovered the famous Google Testing on the Toilet posts which provide great advice. The Testing-on-the-Toilet articles are short (~3min reads) and give hands-on examples, ready to be applied immediately. Here are my favorites:

      <description>Over the years i collected some (funny) programming quotes. Lean back and enjoy:
 Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you&amp;rsquo;re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
 Brian W. Kernighan
 Donâ€™t comment bad codeâ€”rewrite it.
 Brian W. Kernighan
 The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements.</description>

      <description>TL;DR  Good unit tests build the foundation of a maintainable and high-quality codebase Unit Tests should help developers to be productive Unit Tests should be fast Unit Tests should be isolated Unit Tests should be deterministic Unit Tests should focus on a single unit Unit Tests should be enduring Unit Tests should be clear, concise and complete  Avoid complex control flow logic like nested ifs or loops Unit Tests should follow a consistent naming pattern like UnitName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior Unit Tests should comply to a consistent structure Unit Tests should be DAMP not DRY   Unit Tests should give developers confidence to deploy and to refactor Test Doubles help to make tests fast and deterministic The overuse of Mocking makes test hard to read and brittle Prefer state verification over interaction verification Prevent brittle tests Prevent flaky tests Read more:  Software Engineering at Google Kent Becks&amp;rsquo;s Programmer Test Principles Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Best Practices for Unit testing    Why good unit tests are important TDD and test engineering culture is considered best practice these days.</description>

      <title>ESlint &#43; Prettier &#43; Typescript = Consistency</title>
      <link>https://gerlacdt.github.io/posts/eslint-prettier-typescript/</link>

      <guid>https://gerlacdt.github.io/posts/eslint-prettier-typescript/</guid>
      <description>Consistency is one of the most important factors in a codebase. It gives new developers an orientation and direction how to write new code. It keeps the code understandable, clear and free from bikeshedding, so developers can focus on real problems instead of indulging in discussions on their preferred codestyle and individual taste.
Consistency can be pertained by strict discipline but if possible you should enforce good style and formatting via opinionated code formatters like Prettier which makes development and collaboration a breeze.</description>

      <description>Recently i decided to switch from MacOS to Linux. I was already an Ubuntu user from 2006 till 2015. So i am used to Linux. Nevertheless i struggled a little bit with the installation of PostgreSQL. For MacOS there is a nice all-in-one package which i recommend: Postgres.app. Everything works out-of-the-box there. In Ubuntu, on the other hand, we need to adjust the default installation a little bit in order to start application development.</description>

      <description>Sometimes when i write small scripts i tend to insert print statements for debugging. After i verified the correctness of my program i want to get rid of all unnecessary debug statements. With Emacs you can delete all lines which match a specific regular expression with M-x flush-lines or with its alias M-x delete-matching-lines. Interactively you can enter your regular expression and all matching lines will be deleted from you cursor position downwards.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Emacs 26.2 was released, see: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/news/NEWS.26.2
In this short guide i want to show how i install Emacs on my MacBook. I use the vanilla Emacs build from https://emacsformacosx.com/. It is just a simple .dmg file.
After installing the dmg file, Emacs is now available on your Mac as an application but not in the terminal-app. The terminal still opens the pre-install Emacs version. To make the new version available you have to create a bash-script and put it in your $PATH.</description>

      <title>Find and Replace in multiple files</title>

      <description>As a software programmer you often have to search and replace a specific string in multiple files because of a refactoring or just improving a variable or function name.
Normally you can use your IDE or your editor for this. But in bigger codebases with thousand or million lines of code it can be very slow. Neither do IDEs work with remote SSH-sessions. In such situations the command-line is pretty handy.</description>

      <description>As a programmer you often search for a specific strings or regexps in multiple files. Previously i used to do this with the well-known GNU-tools find and grep.
The following command searches for main in all *.go files in the current directory and:
1 2  find . -iname &amp;#39;*.go&amp;#39; | xargs grep -inH &amp;#34;main&amp;#34; # -i ignore case, -n print line number, -H print filename   Recently i discovered ag the silver searcher.</description>

      <description>Replacing or searching text with regular expressions is very common. But sometimes it is hard to get them right and you need some playground to try them out. In order to verify regular expressions i used to visit webpages like:
 https://regexr.com/ https://regex101.com/  But these webpages are optimised for perl, javascript or bash expressions and do not support Emacs regular expressions directly. In Emacs you have to consider some peculiarities.</description>

      <description>Introduction Some years ago i was involved in migrating a big IBM Websphere monolith into a microservice landscape. We had a lot of problems with the monolith. Our development speed slowed down. We had many merge conflicts because of too many dependencies in the codebase. We outgrew the monolithic design and decided to introduce microservices. We extracted different domains like payment, booking, user and search. The teams were restructured into two-pizza teams.</description>

 take the 3 first characters of my first name and surname concatenate them: DANiel + GERlach =&amp;gt; Danger  The algorithm can be implemented as a pure function in Javascript:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9  function getNickname(fullname) {  return fullname  .split(/\s+/)  .map(n =&amp;gt; n.substring(0,3))  .</description>
