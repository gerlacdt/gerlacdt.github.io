Unlike back then, today‚Äôs computers compile whole codebases in seconds. Now that is a big improvement and an insane productivity booster!\nFeedback Loops not only have a massive impact on software development but also on digital product management. Speaking of the agile and lean startup movements, both of them focus heavily on shorting feedback loops, e.g. the lean startup method strives for fast customer feedback by building a Minimal Viable Product(MVP). This is similar to the fundamental agile principle: ‚Äúreducing waste‚Äù. In agile terms ‚Äúwaste‚Äù can be: building extra or incomplete features, handoffs, context switches, defects etc.. Whereby the biggest waste is building the wrong product which can be prevented by early customer feedback.\nFeedback Loops are even present in other areas, they a crucial for our learning in general and affect our whole life. Don‚Äôt believe me? Let‚Äôs dive into it.\nFeedback Loops in Software Engineering Feedback is strongly interweaved with a programmer‚Äôs everyday life and one of the major pillar for developers productivity.\n remember the ancient times when computers were programmed with punch cards, you had to hand in your card and the next day you got your compile feedback/error.    Code Reviews / Code inspections purpose is to gain feedback from colleagues to prevent errors. Common wisdom here is the earlier the errors are caught the cheaper the cost to repair. I.e. the faster we get feedback for our code, the less waste/maintainence effort we‚Äôll have later.\n  compilation / static code analysis is the most used tool during development. We use it a hundred times a day to check if our code can be understood by a machine. Years ago we used to compile manually but nowadays our IDEs compile our code during typing in order to provide instant feedback and compile time errors.\n     Technology Time Comment     Code Compilation seconds or\nminutes in Java üòÑ compile multiple times a minute or even JIT (just-in-time) compilation for every code change in IDE, instant feedback about syntax errors   Static Code Analysis minutes more feedback about code quality, potential bugs and security issues   Trunk-Based Development minutes fast integration feedback, avoid long running branches and merge conflicts   TDD seconds fast test suite, feedback if local code change works   Unit Tests seconds ran multiple times per minutes, check local changes   Contract Tests minutes to hours feedback if code changes did not break the API contract   Code Reviews/Inspections minutes to hours 4-eye principle, feedback from colleagues   CI/CD pipeline minutes build every commit, deploy on dev/prod environments, verify with smoke tests   Monitoring/Observability minutes Feedback about system state, fast detection of outages, anomalies and errors, reduced MTTR (Mean Time To Repair)    Kubernetes Control (Feedback) Loop Kubernetes uses Control Loops in order to keep the system as a whole as close as possible to a desired state.\nObserve the current state (check number of replicas) - check differences, compare current state with desired state (one replica is missing) - take action (start one more pod).\nFeedback Loops in Agile Processes and Product Management Digital Product Discovery and Delivery\nBuilding software is not only about programming and technology alone but also include product management, teamwork and work processes. Feedback loops are also crucial for those aspects. The whole agile movement with the agile manifesto is mainly about getting better and faster feedback, e.g. get early feedback from the customer, deploy and release often (continuous delivery), deliver working software frequently (sprints), business people and developers must work together. All mentioned principles are optimized to produce faster feedback. Another critical agile principle is reducing waste - this is accomplished by releasing often and getting customer product feedback as early as possible. The biggest waste in software product development is building the wrong thing and it can be prevented by early feedback.\nOut of the original agile principles, another branch has evolved the lean startup.\n After product release: user feedback is the most valuable. Most users are ruthless and give honest and critical feedback. Better to listen to them in order to keep them happy. If you don‚Äôt, you will end up with Windows 8 and a a new fancy UI with tiles ;) or a new Menubar called ‚ÄúRibbon‚Äù. Microsoft learned a lot back then and listens much more to user feedback nowadays!  Release often on a regularly in order to get fast feedback from customers/users.\n  Agile is not about developing faster but getting faster feedback in order to reduce waste. The biggest waste is if you build something which nobody needs.\n  Lean startup: Build - Measure - Learn (TODO add Picture) feedback loop in order to eliminate uncertainty like will the product be usable, understandable, legal and feasible?\n  Lean startup: build MVP, release as fast as possible, if it it not embarrassing you invested to much time. Real customer feedback is more valuable!\n  agile software development processes like SCRUM, Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban\n  release every Sprint or even more often, to get feedback from customers\n  system integration per commit or at least and of Sprint to get feedback if the system works. We want to avoid BigBang (which basically results of working in isolation without feedback of customers, other teams, other systems)\n  Tight communication of product owners with developers. Fast feedback, will prevent implementing the wrong features\n  Measure KPIs of production systems to get feedback which features are used, which can be removed!\n    Negative and Positive Feedback Loops Feedback loops are also used to keep a system in a correct state, e.g. the thermostat measures the temperature and reacts based on the measurings - increases the heating or turning it off\nThe Software Architect Elevator\nPositive feedback loops enhance or amplify changes; this tends to move a system away from its equilibrium state and make it more unstable.\nNegative feedbacks tend to dampen or buffer changes; this tends to hold a system to some equilibrium state making it more stable.\nThe previously mentioned Kubernetes Control loop is a so-called Negative Feedback loop. - keep a desired state\nPositive Feedback loops - Nuclear Chain reaction,, fire gets bigger with more Oxygen, or simply a possible conclusion of to many cars on the roads is to build more roads which leads to even more cars. One must identify such negative loops and prevent them, for example invest in public transport.\nFeedback Loops in everyday life  Learning is a continuous process which is best when we fail and learn from the feedback. It start as a toddler starting to walk. All of us went to a lot of feedback loops aka falls and stand-up. (falling hurts)  Conclusion The faster you collect feedback, the more productive you are as an individual, as a team, as a department and as a whole company! So if you want to improve it‚Äôs always good to shorten the feedback loops.\n","wordCount":"1198","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-16T10:00:00+02:00","dateModified":"2022-04-16T10:00:00+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Daniel Gerlach"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://gerlacdt.github.io/posts/software-engineering-feedback-loops/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Daniel's programming rants","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://gerlacdt.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://gerlacdt.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)">Home</a>
