; continuous growth mindset
:  lasting success comes from a mindset focused on continuous growth and the process of self-improvement, rather than simply fixating on a single win.

!! Key Elements of Daigo's mindset

* ''Effort over Natural Talent'': Daigo believes that persistence and hard work are more important than innate ability. He argues that by dedicating himself to outworking everyone else, he can overcome the advantages of those with natural talent.

* ''Process over Outcome'': Focusing on the daily process of learning and improving provides a more stable source of motivation than seeking external validation or a specific win. Wins and losses are seen as markers of progress, not the ultimate goal. This approach makes his motivation less fragile and less dependent on luck.

* ''Sustainable Growth'':He cautions against a "reckless devotion" that leads to burnout. True progress requires a sustainable, moderate level of daily practice that can be maintained for years. The goal is to "keep winning" over a long career, not just to win once and burn out.

!! Mindset about mistakes

''Daigo Umehara's mindset on mistakes is that they are not a sign of failure but a necessary part of the learning process''. He believes that:

* ''Failure is a necessary ingredient for success''
* The willingness to **invest in loss** is what separates those who achieve greatness from those who plateau.
* You should not be paralyzed by the **fear of failure**.
* It is crucial to adopt a **growth mindset**, where you view mistakes as learning opportunities and analyze your failures to identify areas for improvement.
* "Only those who feel comfortable toying with defeat figure out how to pull off wins."

He also makes a distinction between winning a single match and the goal of "keeping winning" over a long period. In this context, a loss in a single match can still be a victory if it leads to personal growth.
