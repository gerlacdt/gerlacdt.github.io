!! Key Ideas

;Learning Myths Debunked
:Rereading, Highlighting, Massed Practice (Cramming) do not lead to retention. Give false sense of mastery (illusion of knowing/competence)

;Retrieval Practice
://Self-Testing//: recalling information strengthens the memory trace and makes recalls easier in the future. Flash-Cards and Recalls are good self-testing methods. //Elaboration//: expressing information in your own words, connect it to prior knowledge or personal experience.

;Spaced Repetition
:Spaced effect: reviewing material at increased intervals combats forgetting. Forgetting is your friend: The more challenging the retrieval process is the stronger the memory trace becomes.

;Interleaving
:Mixing up, instead of blocking practice (do all tasks of the same type), mix different types of problem. This forces you to discriminate and choose the correct solution strategy. Interleaving enhances the ability to apply knowledge in different contexts.

;Generation
://Struggle is good//: attempting to solve the problem before shown the solution, even if you fail, improves learning. Active learning: generation forces you to actively engage with the material and make connections.

;Reflection
:take a few minutes to review what was learned. Possible questions: What are the key ideas? What are some examples? What went well (during learning)? What did I not understand well?

;Desirable Difficulties
:Effortful Retrieval: challenges that required effort enhance learning and retention. These difficulties should be desirable, not overwhelming. Varied Practice: practicing in different environments or under different conditions can create desirable difficulties.

;Growth Mindset
:Belief in improvement: intelligence and abilities can be developed through effort and practice fosters motivation, resilience and willingness to embrace challenges. //Learning from Mistakes//: a growth mindset encourages viewing mistakes as opportunities for learning.

;Memory Consolidation
:is the process of ''transferring from short-term to long-term memory''. //Sleep is essential//, sleep is crucial for consolidating memories, //Regular review/practice// over time strengthens memory traces and makes them more durable. Factors affecting memory consolidation: sleep, emotional significance (memories with strong emotion are consolidated more), repetition and retrieval (strengthen consolidation), stress and interference (can disrupt consolidation)

;Calibration
://Knowing what you know and don't know//. Ability to assess your own understanding. Many students suffer from "illusion of knowing after rereading material. //Self-Testing and retrieval practice// helps to identify gaps and calibrate your understanding.

;Metacognition
://Thinking about your thinking// involves reflecting on your learning process and adjust your strategies as needed. Similar to //Calibration//: ask yourself: What do I know? What do I not know? How can I improve?

;Role of Feedback
:Feedback is essential for identifying errors and correcting misunderstandings. It should be specific and timely. Delaying feedback briefly produces long-term learning. Continuous, immediate feedback make you depend on the presence of correction.

!! Memory Traces

''Physical representations of memories''. They are the footprints that learning leaves behind. ''Neural networks'': memory traces involve networks of neurons that activate and strengthened when we learn something new. The more we retrieve and use a memory, the stronger the connections become. ''Memory traces aren't static'', they can modify over time through new experiences and learning. This is why retrieval is so important - it not only strengthens existing traces but also allows us to integrate new information and connections.

!! Encoding

;Encoding
:The first step in memory formation. Encoding is the process of transforming sensory information into a form that can be stored in the brain. The new representations within the brain are called //memory traces//.

!!! Types of encoding

;Sensory Encoding
:processing information through our senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell)

;Semantic Encoding
:focuses on the meaning of information, making connections to prior knowledge

;Effortful Encoding
:requires conscious attention and effort such as when we are studying or learning a new skill

;Automatic Encoding
:without effort such as remembering what we ate for breakfast


''Strong encoding'' leads to stronger memory traces. ''Retrieval practice strengthens encoding'', it makes memories more durable and accessible.
