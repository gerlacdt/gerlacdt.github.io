; Mastery is a Journey, Not a Destination
:  The goal is not to reach a fixed endpoint of "perfection" but to @@color:red; embrace the ongoing practice itself.@@

; The Plateau is Your Friend
: //love the plateau//. the learning curve isn't a straight line upward. It consists of brief, rapid bursts of progress followed by long periods of seemingly stagnant, flat development. Most people get frustrated and quit during these plateaus, but this is where true learning and consolidation of skills happen. @@Loving the plateau means finding joy in the practice itself, rather than in the immediate results.@@

!!! 3 personality types

; the dabbler
:  This person gets excited about a new skill and makes rapid progress, but as soon as the initial excitement fades and the first plateau is reached, they quit and move on to the next new thing.

; the hacker
: his person is willing to put in some effort but is always looking for shortcuts and ways to bypass the hard work. They might learn just enough to "get by" but never truly master a skill.

; the obsessive
: This person works relentlessly for a quick result, but when they don't see immediate progress, they burn out and give up. They are attached to the outcome, not the process.

!!! 5 keys to mastery

; instruction
: Seek out high-quality instruction from a good teacher or mentor.

; Practice
: @@This is the most crucial key. Mastery comes from consistent, dedicated practice.@@

; surrender
: Be humble and willing to be a beginner, 

; Intentionality 
: Have a clear vision of your goals and a commitment to your practice

; the edge
: Continuously challenge yourself and push your limits. Don't be afraid to take risks and experiment, but do so with respect for the practice.

see [[TheWillToKeepWinningDaigo]]

Daigo also focuses on ''process over outcome''. @@color:red; Focus on continuous growth and  improvement and not on short-term goals like winning a match@@. Daigo also loves the practice itself.

//love the plateau// : Daigo's philosophy of "the will to keep winning" is a direct application of this idea. He speaks about the importance of being able to endure periods where you feel like you are not improving, or even losing, in order to grow.

; importance of intrinsic motivation
: Daigo's success isn't just about the money or titles; it's rooted in his love for fighting games. He warns against losing this passion by becoming overly obsessed with winning. This aligns perfectly with Leonard's view that the master's journey is fueled by a deep, internal desire to practice for its own sake. When you find satisfaction in the repetition and the small victories of practice, you're more likely to persist through the inevitable plateaus and setbacks
