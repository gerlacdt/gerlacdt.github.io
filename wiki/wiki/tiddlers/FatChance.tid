!!! Insulin

Eating sugar triggers Insulin in the body in order to control the blood sugar. Although there are other critical effects which are the main problem:

;Insulin Resistence
:High insulin levels over time lead to insulin resistance, where cells become less responsive to insulin's signal to take up glucose. This forces the pancreas to produce even more insulin, creating a vicious cycle.

;Leptin Resistence
:Leptin is a hormone produced by fat cells that signals satiety to the brain, helping regulate appetite and energy balance. Lustig argues that chronically high insulin levels interfere with leptin signaling, leading to leptin resistance. In this state, the brain doesn't receive the "I'm full" signal from leptin, @@color:red;resulting in overeating and further weight gain.@@

;Fat Storage and Inflammation
:@@color:red;Insulin promotes fat storage@@, particularly in the liver and around the abdomen (visceral fat). This type of fat is especially harmful, as it releases inflammatory substances that contribute to metabolic dysfunction and chronic diseases.

!!! Fiber

Fiber is good because it helps to reduce the Insulin response which is the main problem of consuming sugar.

;Slows Sugar Absorption
:Fiber, particularly soluble fiber, forms a gel-like substance in the digestive tract. This gel slows down the rate at which sugar is absorbed into the bloodstream, preventing the sharp spikes in blood glucose and insulin that occur when consuming sugary foods without fiber.

;Reduces the Insulin Response
:By slowing sugar absorption, fiber helps to moderate the insulin response. This is important because chronically elevated insulin levels, driven by high-sugar, low-fiber diets, contribute to insulin resistance and other metabolic problems.

;Promotes Satiety
:Fiber adds bulk to food and slows digestion, which promotes feelings of fullness and satiety. This can help to reduce overall calorie intake and prevent overeating, especially of sugary, processed foods.

;Feeds Gut Microbiota
:Fiber is also a prebiotic, meaning it provides food for beneficial bacteria in the gut. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to improved metabolic health, including better blood sugar control and reduced inflammation.

!!! Food with Fiber

[[AOK|https://www.aok.de/pk/magazin/ernaehrung/gesunde-ernaehrung/einfach-erklaert-was-sind-ballaststoffe/]]

:Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries), Pears

;Vegetables
:Broccoli, Carrots, Brussels sprouts, Spinach, Potatoes with skin,

;Legumes

@@color:red;//It's important to note that processed foods, like white bread, white rice, and many packaged snacks, have had much of their fiber removed. Therefore, focusing on whole, unprocessed foods is key to increasing fiber intake.//@@
