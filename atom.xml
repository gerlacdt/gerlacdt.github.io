<h3 id="why-good-unit-tests-are-important">Why good unit tests are important</h3>
<p>TDD and test engineering culture is considered best practice these
days. Alas, I often encounter projects without tests or with bad
tests. Maybe you experienced this yourself, you changed something in a
specific part of the system and suddenly a lot of unrelated tests
fail. Congratulations, you made the acquaintance of <strong>brittle</strong> tests.
This is not only annoying for developers but also a time killer.
Another kind of bad tests are <strong>flaky</strong> tests. They are
non-deterministic due to relying on remote systems, making network
calls or accessing remote databases. This causes tests to randomly
succeed or fail even when production code has not changed.</p>
<p>Both, brittle and flaky, tests are a serious problems in a codebase
and should be shunned. Otherwise they will succumb progressively more
and more time and effort of the developers. Finally developers are
kept busy with repairing broken tests and productivity suffers. This
can happen in disguise and developers are not even aware of the
problem. In some companies test coverage is treated as a key
metric. Hence if the coverage high, nobody will question the current
situation. Maybe the whole involved team is proud of the high
coverage, not recognizing their real problem.</p>
<p>Maintainable, fast and deterministic unit tests build the foundation
of a sustainable codebase. But unit tests alone are not enough to
guarantee a usable, successful and bug-free application. Additionally
you need system and UI tests in order to verify production
readiness. The <strong>test pyramid</strong> visualizes this.</p>
<img src="/img/test_pyramid.png" alt="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56696132/why-is-ui-testing-at-the-top-of-the-test-pyramid" class="medium-zoom-image" width="300">
<p>System tests and UI tests are good to check your product as a whole,
but these tests are slow, flaky, not repeatable and often are
conducted manually which makes them bad candidates for <a href="https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html">continuous
integration and
delivery</a>. If
system tests fail, it is hard for developers to locate the problem
because the scope of a system test is very broad and not as focused as
in a unit test. Relying heavily in a project on manual regression
testing instead of an exhaustive, automatic test suite is an
anti-pattern, the <strong>test ice cone</strong>. It is the inverse of the test
pyramid and leads to an unsustainable codebase because failing system
tests leave developers in the dark about the root cause and drain
their productivity. Did you ever work in a project with a Jira Board,
cluttered with unresolved Bugs in the backlog? &ndash; all bugs found by
so-called manual QAs or testers.</p>
<img src="/img/ice_cone.jpg" alt="https://watirmelon.blog/testing-pyramids/" class="medium-zoom-image" width="300">
<p>In this article I will focus on unit tests. Good unit tests should be
clean, maintainable and most notably &ldquo;useful&rdquo; for developers. The main
purpose of tests is to save time for developers and keep the code
quality high. But careless use of testing can have negative effects on
productivity and code quality. E.g if developers loose a majority of
their time fixing tests instead of building new features. &ldquo;Wrong&rdquo;
testing can result in a system that requires even more effort to
maintain than without tests and takes more effort to change without
actually improving confidence in the next production release. It is
crucial to identify bad tests and to know how to write good tests.</p>
<p>This blog post is built upon the shoulder of giants. Basically I draw
from the fantastic book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/">Software Engineering at
Google</a>
. Especially from Chapter 12 &ldquo;Unit Testing&rdquo;. I was also heavily
inspired by the article about <a href="https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/programmer-test-principles-d01c064d7934">Programmer Test
Principles</a>
from Kent Beck, the father of TDD.</p>
<h3 id="test-doubles">Test Doubles</h3>
<p><strong>Test Doubles</strong> play a crucial part in writing good unit tests, we&rsquo;ll
see soon. But first, let&rsquo;s define what a Test Double is. A Test Double
is a replacement of a production code class or function. Multiple
types of Test Doubles exist. In my opinion, the three most important
ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Fake</strong> is a simplified implementation of a given interface, for
example a <em>FakeUserRepository</em> &ldquo;fakes&rdquo; the real database repository
behaviour with an in-memory Hashmap. A Fake is used interchangeably
with a real implementation and is typically applied via dependency
injection.</li>
<li>A <strong>Stub</strong> returns predefined, hard-coded values to specific calls
which are internally needed by the <strong>SUT</strong> (System Under Test) to
fulfill the tested behaviour.</li>
<li>A <strong>Mock</strong> is a stub, but additionally checks the interactions of
the mock with its environment. For example, was the mock called with
the expected parameters or was the mocked method called an expected
number of times? Checking the interactions of mocks is also called
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/"><strong>interaction
testing</strong></a>.
Naturally both, Stubbing and Mocking, is realized via
mock-frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>An exhaustive list of Test Double types can be found in <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDouble.html">Martin
Fowler&rsquo;s article</a>.</p>
<p>The following is a fake implementation of a UserRepository. An
in-memory Hashmap replaces a real database. The Fake can be used by a
unit test via dependency injection. There will be a relevant example
with an example usage later on.</p>

</div><h3 id="what-makes-a-good-unit-test">What makes a good unit test?</h3>
<p>There are a lot of opinions floating around about how to write good
unit tests. In the following I list the traits which I consider most
important.</p>
<h5 id="tests-should-be-fast">Tests should be fast</h5>
<p>A useful test suite will be run frequently, sometimes multiple times a
minute, and therefore must be fast, i.e. a few seconds at
most. Loosing focus during the run is unwanted because it decreases
productivity and breaks the flow. Further if unit tests are slow,
developers will not run tests regularly or skip running them
completely. Then tests will loose their purpose, namely providing fast
feedback. Martin Fowler speaks of a <strong><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html">compile suite and a commit
suite</a></strong>. Normally
developers work on a specific part or unit of a system like a single
file or class. With every compilation, they only run the related tests
to get feedback as fast as possible. Hence this group of tests is the
&ldquo;compile suite&rdquo;. The compile suite comprises the smallest set of tests
which verify the correctness of the unit of the system which is
currently worked on. After finishing a feature or bugfix, before
committing, all unit tests are run to check if nothing else is
broken. Hence this group of tests is called the &ldquo;commit suite&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The optimal duration of a unit test is in the nanosecond
range. Hundred milliseconds sounds fast for a single unit test but it
is too slow if you think about a project with multiple thousand
tests. All tests would take minutes to complete. A developer will only
reluctantly wait or even worse he will skip running the tests.</p>
<p>Tests, relying on network calls, database queries or time related
logic, are inherently slow. Test Doubles are a mechanism to make tests
fast and reliable. With a Test Double you <em>inject</em> a fake
implementation replacing the database or HTTP call. This technique is
well known as <a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#InversionOfControl">Dependency
Injection</a>.</p>
<p>In the code block below the UserService uses the UserRepository to
carry out the intended business logic. A real UserRepository talks
naturally to a database and is too slow for a unit test. Here the real
database implementation is substituted with a FakeUserRepository from
above.</p>

</div><h5 id="tests-should-be-isolated">Tests should be isolated</h5>
<p>Tests should be independent from each other. It must be possible to
run the tests in any order, concurrently and in parallel. This becomes
especially important when the project is big and contains thousand of
tests. In order to speed up the build, the workload can be distributed
across different machines. The distribution logic is very simple if
the tests are isolated. Contrary, it would be very hard or even
impossible to distribute tests which make up a complex dependency
graph. Further any single unit test should be able to run alone
without depending on other unit tests, files, network I/O, and
databases.</p>
<p>Below there is an example of a bad unit test. The second test depends
on the first one and it will fail if the first test does not run
before or fails. Not only this eradicates the possibility to
distribute the tests but also developers will have a hard time to
figure out the root cause of the potential error. Did the second test
fail because of itself or because of the test before?</p>

</div><h5 id="tests-should-be-deterministic">Tests should be deterministic</h5>
<p>A deterministic test never changes its outcome when there was no
change of behaviour. A test switching from green to red or the other
way around without any change is called flaky. Test Doubles are a good
way to get rid of flaky dependencies like external network or database
calls. The earlier example with the FakeUserRepository demonstrates
this.</p>
<h5 id="tests-should-focus-on-a-single-unit-of-the-system">Tests should focus on a single unit of the system</h5>
<p>A unit test should focus on a single part of the system. If a unit
tests breaks, it should be easy to find the root cause. The other way
around is also true: If someone changes a unit, only corresponding
unit tests should possibly break. If you need to start a debugger to
figure out what went wrong, the chance is high that your tests are too
diffuse and include much more than a single unit.</p>
<p>Unit tests which not focus on a single unit tend to be brittle because
they will fail if some other part of the system changes. Brittle tests
are a serious problem because developers loose trust in the test suite
and they neglect badly needed refactorings. This hampers
maintainability and causes the quality of the codebase to
degrade. More often than not, in many projects existing unit tests are
more a burden than a backing for the developers.</p>
<h5 id="tests-should-be-enduring">Tests should be enduring</h5>
<p>Strive for unchangeable tests. A test should be written once and never
be touched except there is a change of behaviour in the corresponding
unit. Changes of internals should never break a test if the behaviour
stays the same. Like i mentioned earlier these are brittle tests. We
should prevent them at any cost.</p>
<p>Brittle tests can creep into the codebase because of the overuse of
mocks. Mocks verify if specific methods get called. Hence mocks know
about the internal implementation which makes the tests prone to
failures. If the internal implementation changes, you need to adjust
all tests which use related mocks. In large codebases this means a lot
of effort.</p>
<p>Test only <em>public</em> methods. I often see developers who test private
methods. Therefore they make them public or protected. This
contradicts the concept of information hiding and low coupling. Then
you expose the internals of a unit which makes it impossible to switch
the internal implementation without breaking a majority of
tests. Additionally, you crippled the module&rsquo;s contract and swamped
its interface with confusing public methods which should be private.</p>
<h5 id="tests-should-be-clear-concise-and-complete">Tests should be clear, concise and complete</h5>
<p>A test should be clear, concise and complete. What does that mean
exactly? A clear test is easy to read and to understand. Tests should
not include complex logic like nested if-conditions or complicated
loops. A clear test is a simple sequence of expressions without any
branching. Consistency is critical. All tests in a project should
comply to a common structure like <em>arrange-act-assert</em> or
<em>given-when-then</em>. A consistent structure reduces cognitive load and
gives developers, unfamiliar with the codebase, a prescriptive model
how a test should look like. A consistent naming pattern adds clarity
and bolsters readability. A collection of common patterns can be found
<a href="https://dzone.com/articles/7-popular-unit-test-naming">here</a>. My
preferred one is <code>UnitName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior</code>.  Rich
failure messages are important too. A message with a detailed context
where and why the test failed, reduces debugging effort
immensely. According to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-best-practices">Microsoft</a>
you should create a separate test for each assertion. In case of a
test failure, a single assertion helps to demystify the error. Most
testing-frameworks anyway stop during the first assertion error per
test. At best, a visible correlation from the test name to the
assertion statement exist.</p>
<p>The following test shows one good assertion and some
unnecessary ones:</p>

</div>
</div><p>Completeness and conciseness contradict themselves. A good test finds
a balance of both. The highest priority is readability though which is
fostered by completeness. A <em>complete</em> test contains all dependencies,
pre-configured objects and data needed to run the test. The apt
developer must resist the urge to make the test too DRY (Don&rsquo;t Repeat
Yourself). DRY code scatters important shared logic and hurts
readability. Relying too much on shared helper classes and functions
reduces the amount of code but increases coupling and makes tests
brittle. <a href="https://testing.googleblog.com/2019/12/testing-on-toilet-tests-too-dry-make.html">Google&rsquo;s Testing on the Toilet
Blog</a>
favors the <strong>DAMP</strong> principle (<em>Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases</em>)
over the DRY principle for tests. A little duplication improves
comprehension and should be preferred over uniqueness. If you think
complete tests are too verbose or your tests require lots of setup
code, it could be an indicator that your production code is flawed and
you should rethink your overall design.</p>
<p>The following examples show a test in a DRY and a DAMP version. The
DRY version uses shared helper functions like <code>createUsers()</code> or
<code>validate()</code> with unclear semantics. The DAMP version replaces these
magical functions with a simple constructor call and an assertion
statement.</p>

</div><p>Nevertheless conciseness is important too and must not be neglected. A
deliberate usage of shared helpers makes this possible. For example,
after calling the helper function you could explicitly set the needed
properties for the test on the returned object. So you utilize the
shared helper function but also decouple the test from it. Further the
relevant properties, needed by the test, are made prominent and the
test will be stable even if someone changes the helper logic. The
example below illustrates that.</p>

<p>Finally your test suite should give you confidence that your code
changes are correct and you did not break anything. A green suite is
an indicator that you can deploy to production without worries. Green
tests should give the individual developer a good feeling about his
code changes. Thereby tests act as a productivity booster so you can
make changes faster and deliver features in less time &ndash; always
feeling good at it.</p>
<h4 id="the-fallacy-of-mocking">The Fallacy Of Mocking</h4>
<p>We learned that mocks make unit tests fast and deterministic. They
prevent flaky tests because they replace unstable calls or slow
network calls with predefined, hard-coded behaviour. There is a catch
though. The overuse of mocking or stubbing has a negative effect on
your test code quality:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Tests become unclear because mock statements bloat the code and
make the test hard to comprehend. The maintainability of your test
code suffers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tests become brittle. The more you mock, the more internals of the
SUT are leaked. Changing the internals, even without changing the
behaviour of the SUT, could make the test fail which contracts the
principle of enduring tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A need of too many mocks could be an indicator of bad design. Most
probably the SUT has too many dependencies and responsibilities and
should be divided.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/">Google</a>
also warns about the overuse of mock-frameworks and interaction
testing. Nevertheless interaction testing is sometimes the only way
to check the code correctness. For example in order to check a
caching logic, you need to call a function twice. First to get object
and to fill the cache, second to get the object from the cache. Both
returned objects are indistinguishable. The only way to verify that
the second object was retrieved from the cache is to check if the
cache was called. Another insight from Google is that they prefer
<em>Fakes over Mocks</em>. Fakes are not that intrusive and the test code is
not swamped by stubbing-behaviour statements.</p>
<h4 id="final-words">Final words</h4>
<p>I know some presented traits are idealistic. Ideals are often hard or
even impossible to achieve. Nevertheless these &ldquo;ideals&rdquo; should serve
you as a guide star. I hope you gained some new insights and
understand that good unit tests play a crucial part for a successful
software project. Especially identifying good and bad tests is
important, so you do not fall into the trap of brittle or flaky
tests. Eventually tests exist to make the life of developers
easier. When tests do not increase productivity, confidence and code
quality, they failed their purpose. I also hope that i could eliminate
some fallacies about mocking or that chasing a 100% code coverage is
nonsense. As long developers feel confident about their codebase and
refactorings are done regularly everything is fine.</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Consistency is one of the most important factors in a codebase. It
gives new developers an orientation and direction how to write new
code. It keeps the code understandable, clear and free from
bikeshedding, so developers can focus on real problems instead of
indulging in discussions on their preferred codestyle and individual
taste.</p>
<p>Consistency can be pertained by strict discipline but if possible you
should enforce good style and formatting via opinionated code
formatters like <a href="https://prettier.io">Prettier</a> which makes
development and collaboration a breeze. One of the forerunners of code
formatters was <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt">gofmt</a>. Prior to gofmt
opinionated formatters were not so popular (at least not to my
knowledge). Basically gofmt defines the de facto Go formatting
style. The result of <em>gofmt</em>: almost all serious Go code is formatted
the same way. That&rsquo;s why all Go code looks familiar and is easy to
work with. With Prettier you can achieve the same &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; with
Javascript, Typescript and many other supported languages.</p>
<p>The same is true for linters. They help you to comply with common best
practices and to avoid potential problems. Linters and code formatters
are essential tools for <strong>state-of-the-art software engineering</strong>.</p>
<p>In this article I show you how to setup <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESlint</a>
for <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> with Prettier
support. So let&rsquo;s start.</p>
<p>First you need to install ESlint in your (Typescript) project:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span><span class="lnt">2
</span><span class="lnt">3
</span><span class="lnt">4
</span><span class="lnt">5
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="c1"># install eslint with typescript support</span>
npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

<span class="c1"># install prettier and eslint plugin with for prettier support</span>
npm install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Next we have to configure ESlint so that it works together with
Prettier. Some ESlint rules are not compatible with the Prettier
formatting by default. ESlint is configured via two files
<code>.eslintrc.js</code> and <code>.eslintignore</code>. Both files need to be created in
your project root.</p>

</div><p>Here we define a maximum line length of 80. I am also an advocate of
trailing commas. This setting keeps the git diffs clean and as small
as possible. You can find more in-depth information about Prettier
configuration <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>With all this in place you can lint and format your code base:</p>

</div><p>In the above code block, we had to use the path to the local
<em>node_modules/</em> folder, otherwise the ESlint and prettier binaries
would not be found. I recommend to install Prettier and ESlint as
global npm modules, then you can use them directly. This enables
editors to leverage prettier and ESlint too. You are then able to
incorporate both tools in your usual workflow. For example, i
configured my editor to show ESlint errors during typing and
formatting is done automatically when I save the current file.</p>

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged">lint-staged</a> for this
purpose. They facilitate the configuration of git hooks, so you do not
have to write the corresponding <code>pre-commmit</code> hook manually.</p>

<h3 id="final-words">Final words</h3>
<p>By now, you went through a lot of project setup effort but you have a
stable scaffold on which you can build upon which can be used for your
future projects. I hope your codebase could benefit from the newly
gained consistency. Do not worry if you encounter hundreds of errors
or warnings the first time you run a linter on your project. This is
normal if you already have an existing project and never used static
code analyzers like linters before.</p>
<p>I can only emphasize once more that consistency is one of the most
important characteristics of a good codebase. Especially if your
project has multiple contributors but even if you work
alone. Consistency keeps the code maintainable and helps to keep up
high quality.</p>
<p>When I start working in a new team on a existing codebase, the first
thing I do is checking the codebase regarding consistency. Is the
formatting always the same? Is immutability preferred? Are threads or
asynchronous programming with callbacks used? Or promises? Or
<em>async-await</em>? Can I see re-emergent patterns? Are class, function and
variable names consistent? Is Domain Driven Design used?</p>
<p>The main point is that consistency should be apparent across the whole
codebase and that new team members are able to deduct how code should
look like. <em>The existing codebase acts like a model</em>. For example if
you are in doubt how to write a new controller with a repository, the
following question should be answerable from the existent code: Do
other controllers exist which act as a template?  Do all controllers
comply to the same patterns?  Do they have the same annotations?  Do
they use the same dependency injection methods like constructors,
setters, or field injection?  Are all controllers tested the same way?
Do controllers have the same tests like unit and component tests? If
the model is inconsistent or askew, new team members are left in
uncertainty. They never know if they comply to existing coding
guidelines because the guidelines are not visible in the source code
itself. Even if they are visible but there are exceptions, it is hard
for an outsider to decide what is right. In bad projects, i
encountered lengthy coding guidelines in Confluence and other wikis
but the real code diverged a long time ago from these written
guidelines. The best guidelines and rules are often deducible from the
existing code. Another thing you want to avoid due to lacking
consistency is time consuming and exhausting discussions in pull
requests. To avoid senseless work, be consistent all the time with
your rules and guidelines and stick to them forcefully. Whenever you
can enforce them or check them automatically, do it. It will save you
a lot of time.</p>
<p>I hope I could convince you that consistency matters. And that the
winning trio with ESlint, Prettier and Typescript improves your
codebase.</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently i decided to switch from MacOS to Linux. I was already an
Ubuntu user from 2006 till 2015. So i am used to Linux. Nevertheless i
struggled a little bit with the installation of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>. For MacOS there is a nice
all-in-one package which i recommend:
<a href="https://postgresapp.com">Postgres.app</a>. Everything works
out-of-the-box there. In Ubuntu, on the other hand, we need to adjust
the default installation a little bit in order to start application
development.</p>
<p>In this little guide i want to give you a short description how to
setup PostgreSQL for <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu 19.04</a> for
development. For the impatient i compiled all important commands at
the end of this article. So if you are already familiar with Linux you
can skip the main part.  Keep in mind this guide is not for production
usage!</p>
<h2 id="installation-instructions">Installation instructions</h2>
<p>First install the deb-package via apt-get:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1
</span></code></pre></td>
<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">sudo apt-get install postgresql
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Afterwards PostgreSQL is available on your system. During the
installation a postgres OS-user with database admin permissions is
added to your system. And here is the problem.  For local users <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/auth-peer.html">peer
authentication</a> is
activated by default. This means Postgres relies on OS-users for
authentication. You have to issue all commands with the <strong>postgres</strong>
OS-user from the shell. For development purposes this is cumbersome
and you want a normal <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/auth-password.html">user/password
authentication</a>.
Hence you need to add a password to your existing postgres user:</p>
<pre><code># login with the postgres OS-user (this user has db-admin permissions and can create new users and databases)
sudo -u postgres psql

# now you can add a password in the psql-shell
psql&gt; \password postgres
</code></pre><p>Now you can switch from &ldquo;peer&rdquo; authentication to &ldquo;md5&rdquo; authentication
which is the Postgres version of password authentication.  Change all
occurrences of &ldquo;peer&rdquo; to &ldquo;md5&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Method&rdquo;-column in
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/auth-pg-hba-conf.html">/etc/postgresql/11/main/pg_hba.conf</a>. Your
<strong>pg_hba.conf</strong> file should look like this:</p>

your new and shiny PostgreSQL database. Do not forget this

would use a cloud-provider DB-Service like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds/">AWS

<p>In this short guide i want to show how i install Emacs on my MacBook.
I use the vanilla Emacs build from <a href="https://emacsformacosx.com/">https://emacsformacosx.com/</a>.
It is just a simple <em>.dmg file</em>.</p>
<p>After installing the <em>dmg file</em>, Emacs is now available on your Mac as
an application but not in the terminal-app. The terminal still opens
the pre-install Emacs version. To make the new version available you
have to create a bash-script and put it in your <code>$PATH</code>.</p>

<h2 id="my-emacs-startup-workflow">My Emacs startup workflow</h2>
<p>When i start a session i run the emacs-server with <code>emacs --daemon</code>. This runs emacs in the background. Afterwards you can use
<code>emacsclient</code> to open files. From now on <em>emacsclient</em> does not
startup a full Emacs instance but utilises the running
emacs-server. Basically emacs opens instantly!</p>
<p>Additionally i created some bash aliases in my <code>~/.zshrc</code> or
<code>~/.bashrc</code> in order to shorten the emacs commands.</p>

GNU-tools <code>find</code> and <code>grep</code>.</p>
<p>The following command searches for <code>main</code> in all <code>*.go</code> files in the
current directory and:</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

<td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">find . -iname <span class="s1">&#39;*.go&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span> xargs grep -inH  <span class="s2">&#34;main&#34;</span>
<span class="c1"># -i ignore case, -n print line number, -H print filename</span>
</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p>Recently i discovered <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">ag the silver
searcher</a>. <code>ag</code> is
much faster than <code>grep</code> and searches directories recursively by
default. <code>ag</code> respects out-of-the-box your <code>.gitignore</code> files.</p>
<p>You can install <code>ag</code> on a Mac with <a href="https://brew.sh/">brew</a>, <code>brew install the_silver_searcher</code>.  The following command searches all
files in your current directory for the string &ldquo;main&rdquo;.</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">
<table class="lntable"><tr><td class="lntd">
<pre class="chroma"><code><span class="lnt">1

</code></pre></td></tr></table>
</div>
</div><p><img src="/img/ag_silver_searcher.png" alt="ag_silver_searcher"></p>
<p><code>ag</code> considers your <code>.gitignore</code> automatically but you can tweak it
even more with your own <code>.agignore</code> file. I put my <code>.agignore</code> file in
my <code>$HOME</code> folder so <code>ag</code> can find it everywhere.</p>
<div class="highlight"><div class="chroma">

escape parentheses.</p>
<p>Recently i learnt about <code>M-x regexp-builder</code> with which you can test
your regular-expressions interactively. Just enter the regular
expression and the text in your buffer will be highlighted
immediately. It even considers different capture groups and highlights
them in different colours. Very nice!</p>

                <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Some years ago i was involved in migrating a big IBM Websphere
monolith into a microservice landscape. We had a lot of problems with
the monolith. Our development speed slowed down. We had many merge
conflicts because of too many dependencies in the codebase. We outgrew
the monolithic design and decided to introduce microservices. We
extracted different domains like payment, booking, user and
search. The teams were restructured into two-pizza teams.</p>
<p>The whole migration was very structured and well planned. We migrated
incrementally with the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/strangler">strangler
pattern</a>.
As long we were ~20 developers in 5 different teams, everything was
fine. Teams worked independently in their domain. They could scale,
deploy independently and followed their own release cycles.</p>
<p>But microservices bring new technical challenges. Maybe you know the saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Microservices solve organizational problems.</p>
<p>Microservices cause technical problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://speakerdeck.com/peterbourgon/go-plus-microservices-equals-go-kit?slide=15">Peter Bourgon</a></p>
<p>Developers tend to ignore, forget or just simply do not know about
these challenges. They are overwhelmed by the new opportunities in the
shiny microservice world. In the following i want to present my
experience what we underestimated or forgot in our
microservice-migration.</p>
<h2 id="avoid-a-heterogeneous-it-landscape">Avoid a heterogeneous IT-landscape</h2>
<p>Microservices give you a lot of freedom which technology to choose
like programming language, database or web-framework. This is both
boon and bane. On the one side every team can choose the technology
which fits best, on the other side developers are adventurous and try
out new fancy programming languages and other bleeding edge
technology. And soon you have a dozen different tech stacks to
support. Some teams build their own tech-knowledge silos. And don&rsquo;t
get me wrong here, it is totally fine if a team has its
domain-knowledge silo, but it is not fine if the team is the only one
in the company who uses a fancy programming language.  At Google, they
have thousands of engineers and they try to stick to only 4 languages
in the backend. The supported languages are C++, Java, Python and Go,
see <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01715.pdf">Software Engineering at Google, Fergus
Henderson</a>.  If a backend team
wants to start with another language they need to argument very hard
why they cannot fulfil their job with the company-wide supported
languages. There is a clear decision-process in place how to introduce
a new technology. This restricts the developers from using the newest
bleeding-edge technology.  Another advantage is that one can focus on
business problems and avoid discussions about tech explorations
etc. Your internal libraries need to be written in and supported for
few languages. Developers will also have an easy time when they want
to switch teams. Team rotation is encouraged, facilitates
knowledge-transfer and pushes developers out of their comfort zone
which makes them more valuable.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/de/radar">technology radar</a> serves as
an overview for the supported tools, programming languages and
platforms. A radar helps to keep track of all technology used in your
company.</p>
<h2 id="have-a-good-monitoringtracinglogging-in-place">Have a good Monitoring/Tracing/Logging in place</h2>
<p>We suffered sometime from logging problems because our ElasticSearch
cluster was overloaded or some indices had conflicts. Logging is
hard. Make sure you have clear logging-guildlines. Do not log too
much, at best you have <a href="https://peter.bourgon.org/blog/2016/02/07/logging-v-instrumentation.html">silent
services</a>,
i.e. only log if a manual intervention is needed in case of an
error. Logging is fine for debugging and error tracking in the
development stage but it should not be overused in production. Be
careful if your monitoring and alarming is based on logging. If your
log-cluster is flooded, your monitoring will not work either!</p>
<p>Have strict rules for monitoring. No service should go into production
without monitoring. With microservices you need transparency in order
to do failure analysis or get notified if something is wrong. At least
monitor the <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals">four golden
signals</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Latency. How high is the response time? Make sure you distinguish
failed requests from successful requests. Failed requests can be
fast and screw up your metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traffic. How many Requests per second (RPS) do we serve?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Errors. How high is the error rate? </br>
Number of error responses / Number of successful responses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturation. How full is your service? CPU utilisation, memory
consumption.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="dont-forget-the-8-fallacies-of-distributed-computing">Don&rsquo;t forget the 8 fallacies of distributed computing</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing">Fallacies of distributed computing by Peter
Deutsch</a></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The network is reliable.</p>
<p>Your HTTP-calls will fail from time to time. So make sure you have
some retry-mechanism in place. But do not retry naively!
E.g. retries make no sense if the http response code is 400
BAD_REQUEST, no matter how often you try the request will never be successful.
Neither you should do retries on POST requests, HTTP POST requests
are by definition not idempotent and you could accidentally create a
lot of resources like orders or trigger payments. Your customers will not
be happy.</p>
<p>You should also limit your retries, do not retry indefinitely,
otherwise you can cause overload on other services, see
<a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/addressing-cascading-failures/">cascading failures</a>.</p>
<p>Do not forget to protect your services with timeouts. Missing timeouts
make I/O calls wait too long and if they pile up they consume all
your memory or other resources like a thread pool. In the worst case you service will be killed by your docker scheduler because the memory limit is exceeded.</p>
<p>For very high-load services you should consider <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/addressing-cascading-failures/#xref_cascading-failure_load-shed-graceful-degredation">load shedding or
graceful degradation</a>
in order to protect these service from going down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Latency is zero.</p>
<p>Network can be slow. You should clearly separate internal function
calls from network calls. E.g. do not use network calls in
loops. Better fetch everything with one network call.</p>

<li>
<p>Bandwidth is infinite.</p>
<p>Use your bandwidth sparingly. E.g logging every http request and
response is definitely too much. Do not use  sql-statements like this:
<code>SELECT * from  table</code>, always select only required columns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network is secure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topology doesn&rsquo;t change.</p>
<p>Especially with self-healing services and docker random port usage,
IP-addresses and ports change often. Do not use static IP-addresses
or static ports. Use sophisticated service-discovery
mechanisms. Many Docker-Scheduler provide them out-of-the-box like
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> or <a href="https://www.nomadproject.io/">Hashicorp&rsquo;s
Nomad</a>. With <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">AWS
ECS</a> you can use an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html">AWS Application
Load Balancer</a> (ALB) for service discovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is one administrator.</p>
<p>Distributed systems are complex. Do not expect that there is
one person who knows it all. For bug analysis you need multiple
people or teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transport cost is zero.</p>
<p>Network calls are expensive. You need to establish a connection,
you need to serialize and deserialize the message body which cost
CPU. The less you send the better. If you notice that you
services are chatty, consider restructuring the domain
boundaries. Most probably your domains do overlap or have multiple
responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network is homogeneous</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not. Before docker, almost all applications ran on customized,
&ldquo;snowflaky&rdquo; servers configured via non-reproducible
ssh-session. With Kubernetes or AWS ECS you can have clusters with
thousands of servers which are configured exactly the same. One
single DevOps guy can operate thousands of servers! Therefore you
should agree on a common cluster management tool with as few
clusters as possible. Only then, you gain the real advantages of
Docker. Further agree on a single data transfer format like
<a href="https://www.json.org/">JSON</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol
Buffers</a> with
<a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a>. Strive for as much homogeneity as
possible to reduce operation and maintenance costs. In my opinion
the homogeneity provided by Docker is its biggest advantage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="other-things-to-consider">Other things to consider</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep your domain boundaries clear and separated. Teams should always
be able to deploy independently and without consulting other
teams. You ever experienced a deployment where 3 or 4 services were
involved and had to be deployed synchronously because of
incompatibilities of API-versions or dependency on the same database.
Congratulations you built a distributed monolith.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a good CI/CD pipeline with automatic tests and deployments.
Make sure all teams use the same deployment and glue scripts. Use
one cluster (Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Hashicorp Nomad) for the whole
company (as long as you do not exceed hundreds of servers). This
will keep the maintenance effort low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have reusable modules/libraries, make sure you have
transitive CI-builds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adhere to good coding cloud-native practices, see
<a href="https://12factor.net">12-factor-app</a> and <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/books/">Site Reliability
Engineering</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Microservices are hard. Do not forget this. In the web you hear mainly
about the big success-stories like Google, Amazon and the like. But
for the most of us there are serious disadvantages which are normally
not mentioned. And do not get me wrong, microservices are great. It
was definitely the way to go for us. Today we are more than 100
developers and it gives me the creeps when i imagine that all of them
would work on single monolithic git-repository.  It is a long and hard
way to a productive microservice landscape but definitively worth
it. Just do not underestimate monitoring, automation and the fallacies
of distributed systems!</p>
